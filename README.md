# DubaiRealEstatePricePrediction
Analyze real estate sales data around Dubai for a few months and create a model to identify off-market and distressed sales during this period using isolation forest.

A static data set containing transactions of type; sales,mortages and gifts, was downloaded from the website-https://dubailand.gov.ae/en/open-data/real-estate-data/. Numerical and categorical features were studied, and relevant ones were chosen (also ended up adding a few) in order to identify 'off-market' transactions using isolation forest.
